        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            - 2 slices of sourdough bread
        </p>
        <p>
            - 1 avocado
        </p>
        <p>
            - 1 garlic clove (chopped into small pieces)
        </p>
        <p>
            - 1/4 of a small onion (chopped into small pieces)
        </p>
        <p>
            - Mustard (about a teaspoon)
        </p>
        <p>
            - Juice from 1 lime
        </p>

        <p>
            - Cheese (any type you want)
        </p>
        <p>
            - Spices (anything you want)
        </p>
        <p>
            - Olive oil
        </p>
        <p>
            - Cilantro
        </p>
        <p>
            - Optional: Thinly sliced tomatoes
        </p>
        <h3>
            Steps
        </h3>
        <p>
            1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Put the sourdough slices in a toaster just long enough so that they start to get brown.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. While the bread is in the toaster, cut the avocado in half, and mash it in a bowl. I think it’s better if you don’t over-do the mashing.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. Now mix in the garlic, onion, mustard, some of the lime juice, and the spices in with the avocado. Some good spices/herbs to add are pepper, paprika, red pepper flakes, and parsley. You can  pretty much anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Lay the toasted sourdough on a plate and spread the guacamole you have just made on it. If there is guacamole left over, squeeze the rest of the lime over it and put it in the fridge. The lime juice will stop the guacamole from turning brown. Optional: add on tomatoes
        </p>
        <p>
            6. Now lay your cheese (slices or grated) on top of the guacamole on both of the sourdough slices, so that it’s completely covering the guacamole.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. Place into the oven until the cheese is melted.
        </p>
        <p>
            8. When you take it out put some olive oil, salt, and some spices and cilantro on top! Now all that’s left is to turn on a lo-fi chill beats playlist to really set the hipster tone ;)
